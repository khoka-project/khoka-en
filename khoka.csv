On a pharmacological level, cocaine is unique among local anesthetics in its ability to block the reuptake of key neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin, producing stimulant effects and euphoria.

However, recreational use of cocaine carries significant risks. Its ability to increase the release and block the reuptake of dopamine in the brain can lead to increased neuronal activity resulting in severe side effects, such as tachycardia, hypertension, and in extreme cases, cardiac arrhythmias and nervous breakdowns. Additionally, combining cocaine with alcohol produces cocaethylene, a compound with increased toxic potential and cardiotoxicity.

Cocaine also has two ester groups that are hydrolyzed both in vitro and in vivo to benzoylecgonine and methyl ecgonine ester, contributing to its metabolism and elimination from the body. Its mechanism of action, similar to that of other anesthetics by blocking sodium channels and thus the transmission of nerve impulses, together with its unique effects on neurotransmitters, make it a drug of high medical and pharmacological interest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gallic acid,Gallic acid,Phytol2,"Phytol is an organic compound known as a diterpenoid, a type of fatty alcohol that forms an essential part of chlorophyll, the pigment that gives plants their green color and plays a crucial role in photosynthesis, the process by which plants They convert sunlight into chemical energy. When released from chlorophyll during its degradation, phytol displays a series of beneficial biological properties.

This secondary metabolite has been studied for its multiple biological effects, which include anxiolytic actions, helping to reduce anxiety; antioxidants, protecting cells from oxidative damage; cytotoxic, with the potential to kill cancer cells; and anti-inflammatory, reducing inflammation in the body. These properties make phytol of interest in various areas of research and development, from pharmacology to nutrition and cosmetics, where its use could be key to developing innovative treatments and dietary supplements.

Glucopyranose,Glucopyranose,Aldehydes,"Aldehyde, any of a class of organic compounds in which a carbon atom shares a double bond with an oxygen atom, a single bond with a hydrogen atom, and a single bond with another atom or group of atoms . The double bond between carbon and oxygen is characteristic of all aldehydes and is known as the carbonyl group. Many aldehydes have pleasant odours, and in principle, they are derived from alcohols by dehydrogenation (removal of hydrogen), from which process came the name aldehyde.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
5-0-Coumaroyl-D-quinic acid,5-0-Coumaroyl-D-quinic acid,Carbohydrates,"As a chemical term, “sugar” usually refers to all carbohydrates of the general formula Cn(H2O)n. Sucrose is a disaccharide, or double sugar, being composed of one molecule of glucose linked to one molecule of fructose. Because one molecule of water (H2O) is lost in the condensation reaction linking glucose to fructose, sucrose is represented by the formula C12H22O11 (following the general formula Cn[H2O]n − 1).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Galactinol,Galactinol,Amino acids,"Amino acid, any of a group of organic molecules that consist of a basic amino group (―NH2), an acidic carboxyl group (―COOH), and an organic R group (or side chain) that is unique to each amino acid. The term amino acid is short for α-amino [alpha-amino] carboxylic acid. Each molecule contains a central carbon (C) atom, called the α-carbon, to which both an amino and a carboxyl group are attached. The remaining two bonds of the α-carbon atom are generally satisfied by a hydrogen (H) atom and the R group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
4-0-Coumaroyl-D-quinic acid,4-0-Coumaroyl-D-quinic acid,Alkaloids,"Alkaloid, any of a class of naturally occurring organic nitrogen-containing bases. Alkaloids have diverse and important physiological effects on humans and other animals. Well-known alkaloids include morphine, strychnine, quinine, ephedrine, and nicotine.
Alkaloids are found primarily in plants and are especially common in certain families of flowering plants. In fact, as many as one-quarter of higher plants are estimated to contain alkaloids, of which several thousand different types have been identified. In general, a given species contains only a few kinds of alkaloids, though both the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) and the ergot fungus (Claviceps) each contain about 30 different types. Certain plant families are particularly rich in alkaloids; all plants of the poppy family (Papaveraceae) are thought to contain them, for example. The Ranunculaceae (buttercups), Solanaceae (nightshades), and Amaryllidaceae (amaryllis) are other prominent alkaloid-containing families. A few alkaloids have been found in animal species, such as the New World beaver (Castor canadensis) and poison-dart frogs (Phyllobates). Ergot and a few other fungi also produce them.
